 These are some simple games I wrote as part of a Coursera course I completed in 2014.  Code was originally written using Codeskulptor.

	CodeSkulptor is a browser-based Python interpreter, as featured in the online course “An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python”. It implements a subset of Python 2, plus the addition of three graphical libraries, SimpleGui, SimpleMap, and SimplePlot.
